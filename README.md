# Flask Project Implementations

This repository contains a collection of **Flask-based practice projects** that demonstrate core backend development concepts, including routing, authentication, CRUD operations, API integrations, and database management.

The projects are intentionally kept simple and focused on learning fundamentals rather than production-ready architecture.

## Purpose

This repository is intended for:
- Learning Flask fundamentals
- Practicing backend development concepts
- Experimenting with authentication and database operations

It is not intended for production use.

## Notes

- Security, validation, and error handling are minimal
- API credentials and secrets should never be committed to source control
- Some database operations rely on raw SQL and may be database-specific
